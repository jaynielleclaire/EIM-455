        <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
        <p>
            Orthopedic surgeries often require intermittent use of pulsed fluoroscopy (Fig 1)—real-time X-ray imaging—at various points throughout the procedure. Such procedures include hip fracture, knee replacement, minimally invasive surgeries, and hand surgeries [1]. This imaging involves taking numerous radiation "shots" or pulses, typically around a hundred in a single surgery, though the exact number depends on the surgeon’s expertise; more experienced surgeons may require fewer images [1]. Prolonged exposure to such radiation over years can increase the risk of thyroid cancer, making protective measures essential. For instance, using a thyroid shield can reduce effective radiation dose by approximately 2.5 times and overall exposure by nearly 50% [2].
        </p>
        <p>
            During fluoroscopy, the surgical team members—including the surgeon, radiologic technician, surgical assistant, and scrub nurse—wear personal protective equipment (PPE) like thyroid shields (Fig 2) and lead gowns (typically 0.5 mm thick, fully wrapped as seen in Fig 3) to minimize exposure. Other team members, such as the circulating nurse and anaesthesiologist, usually stay behind a lead shield (Fig 4) when imaging is active. The layout of personnel around the operating table is often arranged to optimize both access and protection, as shown in Fig 5.
        </p>
        <p> Lead gowns are composed of three layers: </p>
        <p> 1.	Interior lining (canvas): A soft material providing comfort as it is the layer closest to the user's body. </p>
        <p> 2.	Radiation protective material (lead): The core layer responsible for shielding the user from radiation. </p>
        <p> 3.	Exterior material (vinyl or nylon): The outermost, durable, and water-resistant layer that protects the radiation shielding material from damage and wear [1]. </p>
        <p>
            Lead gowns are highly effective, blocking 90-95% of scattered radiation [3]. However, they are quite heavy, ranging from 2 to 7 kilograms [4], and wearing them for extended periods can lead to fatigue and musculoskeletal strain [5]. This project, therefore, seeks to improve the usability and comfort of lead aprons to reduce these physical burdens while maintaining their protective function.

        <h2> 2. Problem Clarification </h2>

        <div id="sub-section-2-header-1">
        <h3> 2.1 Key Insights </h3>
        <table-component subtitle="Table 1: Insights from primary research with healthcare professionals (see more in Appendix B) [10]">
            <div id="table-1"></div>
          </table-component>
        <p>
            Our primary research with healthcare professionals (HCP) highlighted critical issues regarding weight, hygiene, and mobility in current radiation PPE. Below is a breakdown of each category based on practitioners' feedback:
        </p>
        <p>
            Weight: The heavy lead aprons, often weighing up to 7kg, create significant physical strain on practitioners, leading to muscle fatigue and back pain. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hygiene: Shared lead aprons bring about hygiene concerns, as practitioners are uncertain about how often these are cleaned. Due to the intense physical activity involved, wearing aprons underneath scrubs leads to excessive sweating, which raises discomfort levels. Practitioners indicated that cleaning these aprons between uses isn't always feasible, adding to the hygiene issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mobility: The bulkiness and weight of the PPE restrict practitioners' movement, making it challenging to perform certain procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among the issues identified, the weight of lead aprons emerged as a top concern, significantly impacting comfort and safety during prolonged procedures. Notably, 100% of interviewees from the orthopaedics department cited the weight of the aprons as an issue (Fig. 6).

        </div>

      <div id="sub-section-2-header-2">
        <h3> 2.2 Problem Statement </h3>
        <p>
            The weight of the lead apron worn by orthopaedic surgical teams during fluoroscopy-guided surgeries causes significant fatigue, compromising their well-being and quality of life. This physical strain also limits the number of surgeries they can perform each week, impacting both healthcare delivery and practitioner health.

        <h4> 2.3.1 Xenolite Gowns </h4>
        <p>
            Xenolite gowns provide lead-free, lightweight, and flexible x-ray protection by using a carefully balanced mix of antimony and tungsten as shielding elements. This combination is designed to optimize weight while maximizing protection within the diagnostic imaging range of 80–100 kV. Antimony primarily attenuates lower-energy photons (below 88 keV), while tungsten, a heavier element, is effective against higher-energy radiation (above 69 keV). The powdered antimony and tungsten particles are uniformly embedded in a durable yet flexible Dow elastomer matrix, developed by Dow-DuPont for applications requiring resilience and flexibility, like running shoes and cables. This elastomer was chosen for its balance of strength and flexibility, enhancing the apron’s durability and resistance to cracking. Furthermore, the material is environmentally friendly as it is not cross-linked, meaning it can be recycled or safely disposed of as non-hazardous waste [11]. However, Xenolite provides a lead equivalency of 0.5 mm at 80 keV but may offer less protection at higher energy levels (e.g., 100 keV as seen in Table 2), where advanced imaging equipment is often used [5].

        <h4> 2.3.2	Suspended Radiation Protection System (Zero-Gravity) </h4>
        <p>
            Zero-Gravity is a weightless support system that uses a suspended, 1.0 mm lead shield, magnetically attached to a vest worn by the operator. This design allows the system to move smoothly with the user and be easily retracted when not in use. Available in various configurations—such as floor unit, monorail, and hinged swing-arm versions—Zero-Gravity can adapt to different room layouts and procedure requirements. By eliminating the need for heavy protective gear, it minimizes the risk of orthopaedic strain for clinicians, enhancing comfort without compromising radiation protection [14]. Although Zero-Gravity allows some movement, it restricts certain actions like bending and can limit mobility, especially when walking [1].

            Our product, ShieldX, improves comfort and reduces fatigue specifically associated with the weight of radiation PPE (lead gowns) for orthopaedic surgical teams in Singapore. By enhancing weight distribution and decreasing perceived heaviness, ShieldX enables greater mobility and freedom of movement during complex procedures. ShieldX aims to increase user satisfaction regarding the weight aspect of PPE from 0% to 60% by April 2025, all while maintaining current radiation protection standards.
