                <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
                <p>
                    Orthopedic surgeries often require intermittent use of pulsed fluoroscopy (Fig 1)—real-time X-ray
                    imaging—at various points throughout the procedure. Such procedures include hip fracture, knee
                    replacement, minimally invasive surgeries, and hand surgeries [1]. This imaging involves taking
                    numerous radiation "shots" or pulses, typically around a hundred in a single surgery, though the
                    exact number depends on the surgeon’s expertise; more experienced surgeons may require fewer images
                    [1]. Prolonged exposure to such radiation over years can increase the risk of thyroid cancer, making
                    protective measures essential. For instance, using a thyroid shield can reduce effective radiation
                    dose by approximately 2.5 times and overall exposure by nearly 50% [2].
                </p>
                <p>
                    During fluoroscopy, the surgical team members—including the surgeon, radiologic technician, surgical
                    assistant, and scrub nurse—wear personal protective equipment (PPE) like thyroid shields (Fig 2) and
                    lead gowns (typically 0.5 mm thick, fully wrapped as seen in Fig 3) to minimize exposure. Other team
                    members, such as the circulating nurse and anaesthesiologist, usually stay behind a lead shield (Fig
                    4) when imaging is active. The layout of personnel around the operating table is often arranged to
                    optimize both access and protection, as shown in Fig 5.
                </p>
                <p> Lead gowns are composed of three layers: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Interior lining (canvas): A soft material providing comfort as it is the layer closest to the
                        user's body. </li>
                    <li> Radiation protective material (lead): The core layer responsible for shielding the user from
                        radiation. </li>
                    <li> Exterior material (vinyl or nylon): The outermost, durable, and water-resistant layer that
                        protects the radiation shielding material from damage and wear [1]. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Lead gowns are highly effective, blocking 90-95% of scattered radiation [3]. However, they are quite
                    heavy, ranging from 2 to 7 kilograms [4], and wearing them for extended periods can lead to fatigue
                    and musculoskeletal strain [5]. This project, therefore, seeks to improve the usability and comfort
                    of lead aprons to reduce these physical burdens while maintaining their protective function.

                    <p>
                        Our primary research with healthcare professionals (HCP) highlighted critical issues regarding
                        weight, hygiene, and mobility in current radiation PPE. Below is a breakdown of each category
                        based on practitioners' feedback:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Weight: The heavy lead aprons, often weighing up to 7kg, create significant physical strain
                            on
                            practitioners, leading to muscle fatigue and back pain.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>
                            Hygiene: Shared lead aprons bring about hygiene concerns, as practitioners are uncertain
                            about
                            how often these are cleaned. Due to the intense physical activity involved, wearing aprons
                            underneath scrubs leads to excessive sweating, which raises discomfort levels. Practitioners
                            indicated that cleaning these aprons between uses isn't always feasible, adding to the
                            hygiene
                            issue.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>
                            Mobility: The bulkiness and weight of the PPE restrict practitioners' movement, making it
                            challenging to perform certain procedures.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Among the issues identified, the weight of lead aprons emerged as a top concern, significantly
                        impacting comfort and safety during prolonged procedures. Notably, 100% of interviewees from the
                        orthopaedics department cited the weight of the aprons as an issue (Fig. 6).

                    <p>
                        The weight of the lead apron worn by orthopaedic surgical teams during fluoroscopy-guided
                        surgeries causes significant fatigue, compromising their well-being and quality of life. This
                        physical strain also limits the number of surgeries they can perform each week, impacting both
                        healthcare delivery and practitioner health.

                        <p>
                            Xenolite gowns provide lead-free, lightweight, and flexible x-ray protection by using a
                            carefully balanced mix of antimony and tungsten as shielding elements. This combination is
                            designed to optimize weight while maximizing protection within the diagnostic imaging range
                            of 80–100 kV. Antimony primarily attenuates lower-energy photons (below 88 keV), while
                            tungsten, a heavier element, is effective against higher-energy radiation (above 69 keV).
                            The powdered antimony and tungsten particles are uniformly embedded in a durable yet
                            flexible Dow elastomer matrix, developed by Dow-DuPont for applications requiring resilience
                            and flexibility, like running shoes and cables. This elastomer was chosen for its balance of
                            strength and flexibility, enhancing the apron’s durability and resistance to cracking.
                            Furthermore, the material is environmentally friendly as it is not cross-linked, meaning it
                            can be recycled or safely disposed of as non-hazardous waste [11]. However, Xenolite
                            provides a lead equivalency of 0.5 mm at 80 keV but may offer less protection at higher
                            energy levels (e.g., 100 keV as seen in Table 2), where advanced imaging equipment is often
                            used [5].

                        <h4> 2.3.2 Suspended Radiation Protection System (Zero-Gravity) </h4>
                        <p>
                            Zero-Gravity is a weightless support system that uses a suspended, 1.0 mm lead shield,
                            magnetically attached to a vest worn by the operator. This design allows the system to move
                            smoothly with the user and be easily retracted when not in use. Available in various
                            configurations—such as floor unit, monorail, and hinged swing-arm versions—Zero-Gravity can
                            adapt to different room layouts and procedure requirements. By eliminating the need for
                            heavy protective gear, it minimizes the risk of orthopaedic strain for clinicians, enhancing
                            comfort without compromising radiation protection [14]. Although Zero-Gravity allows some
                            movement, it restricts certain actions like bending and can limit mobility, especially when
                            walking [1].

                    <p>
                        Our product, ShieldX, improves comfort and reduces fatigue specifically associated with the
                        weight of radiation PPE (lead gowns) for orthopaedic surgical teams in Singapore. By enhancing
                        weight distribution and decreasing perceived heaviness, ShieldX enables greater mobility and
                        freedom of movement during complex procedures. ShieldX aims to increase user satisfaction
                        regarding the weight aspect of PPE from 0% to 60% by April 2025, all while maintaining current
                        radiation protection standards.

                                <li>Weight Reduction:The lattice design employs a network of geometric
                                    patterns (e.g., hexagonal, grid, or triangular) to distribute material only where
                                    needed, reducing bulk and enhancing flexibility.</li>
                                <li>High Strength-to-Weight Ratio: The framework provides a strong yet
                                    lightweight base, making the gown easier to wear for extended periods.</li>
                                <li>Reinforced Points: Critical load-bearing areas, such as the
                                    shoulders and spine, are strengthened to prevent deformation and sagging under
                                    prolonged use.</li>
                            </ul>

                                    compressed granules, strategically placed within the lattice's openings. This hybrid
                                    construction ensures effective radiation protection while keeping the gown
                                    lightweight.</li>
                                <li>Layered Depth: For enhanced shielding, a triangular lattice design
                                    with multi-layered depth may be used, optimizing impact resistance and stability.

                                <li>Weight Distribution: A load-bearing belt and cross-body strap
                                    system reduce strain by evenly distributing weight, minimizing fatigue during

                    <h3>5.1 Material Selection Using Linear Attenuation</h3>
                    <p>To evaluate radiation protection efficacy, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of linear
                        attenuation properties and potential weight reduction compared to conventional lead aprons.
                        Linear attenuation coefficient (μ) quantifies a material's effectiveness in absorbing or
                        scattering incident radiation, with higher coefficients indicating superior radiation shielding
                        capabilities [15]. This relationship is described by the following equation:</p>
                    <image-component tag="equation-image" source="assets/equation.png"
                        subtitle="Figure 11: Linear Attenuation Equation [15]"></image-component>
                    <p>
                        Our analysis encompassed a range of potential materials including Bismuth, Tungsten, Copper,
                        Zinc, Iron, Magnesium, Aluminium, and Titanium (detailed calculations available in Appendix G).
                        Testing conditions were standardized at 0.5mm thickness and 100keV incident radiation energy,
                        which represents typical diagnostic X-ray conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Tungsten demonstrated superior attenuation compared to pure lead, its significantly higher
                        density (19.3 g/cm³ versus lead's 11.4 g/cm³) rendered it impractical for wearable protection
                        despite its excellent shielding properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most promising alternative composition identified was a 90% lead and 10% bismuth mixture,
                        which achieved an attenuation ratio of 0.0311, compared to pure lead's 0.0315. This combination
                        offers a modest weight reduction of 1.37% while maintaining near-equivalent radiation
                        protection. However, the slight decrease in attenuation efficiency, though minimal, requires
                        careful consideration given the critical nature of radiation protection in medical settings.
                        Further optimization of the material composition may be necessary to achieve equivalent
                        protection while maximizing weight reduction.

                            combination of quantitative data and qualitative feedback will provide crucial insights for
                            optimizing the prototype's design to meet the demanding needs of healthcare professionals in
                            real-world clinical settings.

                    Moving forward, we will continue to refine and validate the feasibility of the LatticeGuard Pro
                    concept by collaborating with materials scientists and radiation physicists/medical physicists. This
                    exploration will focus on optimizing material properties, including density and weight distribution,
                    to achieve the desired balance between radiation shielding effectiveness and user comfort. Should
                    challenges arise that prevent the implementation of LatticeGuard Pro, we will pivot to the
                    SuspendShield Flex concept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept decision will be finalized by December 2024, ensuring a clear direction for the next
                    development phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the final concept is selected, usability testing will commence from January to March 2025.
                    These tests will assess user comfort, ease of movement, and long-term wearability. Additionally, the
                    feedback collected during this phase will inform iterative design improvements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key milestones in 2025 will include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Prototype Refinement: Incorporating usability feedback into the prototype to enhance performance
                        and comfort.</li>
                    <li>Advanced Testing: Collaborating with orthopaedic surgical teams to simulate real-world scenarios
                        and validate the effectiveness of weight distribution mechanisms.</li>
                    <li>Regulatory Preparation: Consulting with regulatory experts to ensure compliance with radiation
                        protection standards and medical device guidelines.</li>
                    <li>Material Scalability Assessment: Evaluating the cost and scalability of selected materials for
                        eventual production, particularly for broader market adoption beyond the initial Singapore
                        focus.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we aim to present the finalized prototype and testing results by April 2025, positioning
                    the product for further commercialization and industry engagement.

                <p>
                    Concept 2 "SuspendShield Flex": The suspended radiation protective system emphasizes user
                    comfort
                    and safety through its sophisticated design approach. Material optimization with
                    high-density
                    lightweight alloys forms the foundation, while elastic fabric panels provide necessary
                    flexibility.
                    The core support system consists of a shoulder harness or suspension system, engineered to
                    distribute weight effectively. Quick accessibility is achieved through magnetic
                    quick-release
                    fasteners, while neck cushioning inserts enhance comfort during extended wear. The system
                    incorporates advanced comfort features including an antimicrobial treatment to maintain
                    hygiene
                    and
                    an active cooling system to regulate temperature, making it particularly suitable for
                    extended
                    periods of use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Concept 3 "NanoTech ArtiFit": This protective suit concept represents a technological
                    advancement in
                    radiation protection through its layered shielding design and nanotechnology integration.
                    The
                    suit
                    features an articulated design with strategic stretch zones, allowing for natural movement
                    while
                    maintaining protection. The external support attachment system works in conjunction with the
                    contoured gown design to optimize weight distribution. Accessibility is enhanced through
                    press-button release clips, while comfort is prioritized with adjustable shoulder pads. The
                    ventilated fabric structure and breathable layering system ensure optimal temperature
                    regulation.
                    The addition of customizable Velcro panels allows for personalized adjustments, making this
                    suit
                    adaptable to various user preferences and requirements.
