                <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
                <p>
                    Orthopedic surgeries often require intermittent use of pulsed fluoroscopy (Fig 1)—real-time X-ray
                    imaging—at various points throughout the procedure. Such procedures include hip fracture, knee
                    replacement, minimally invasive surgeries, and hand surgeries [1]. This imaging involves taking
                    numerous radiation "shots" or pulses, typically around a hundred in a single surgery, though the
                    exact number depends on the surgeon’s expertise; more experienced surgeons may require fewer images
                    [1]. Prolonged exposure to such radiation over years can increase the risk of thyroid cancer, making
                    protective measures essential. For instance, using a thyroid shield can reduce effective radiation
                    dose by approximately 2.5 times and overall exposure by nearly 50% [2].
                </p>
                <p>
                    During fluoroscopy, the surgical team members—including the surgeon, radiologic technician, surgical
                    assistant, and scrub nurse—wear personal protective equipment (PPE) like thyroid shields (Fig 2) and
                    lead gowns (typically 0.5 mm thick, fully wrapped as seen in Fig 3) to minimize exposure. Other team
                    members, such as the circulating nurse and anaesthesiologist, usually stay behind a lead shield (Fig
                    4) when imaging is active. The layout of personnel around the operating table is often arranged to
                    optimize both access and protection, as shown in Fig 5.
                </p>
                <p> Lead gowns are composed of three layers: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Interior lining (canvas): A soft material providing comfort as it is the layer closest to the
                        user's body. </li>
                    <li> Radiation protective material (lead): The core layer responsible for shielding the user from
                        radiation. </li>
                    <li> Exterior material (vinyl or nylon): The outermost, durable, and water-resistant layer that
                        protects the radiation shielding material from damage and wear [1]. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Lead gowns are highly effective, blocking 90-95% of scattered radiation [3]. However, they are quite
                    heavy, ranging from 2 to 7 kilograms [4], and wearing them for extended periods can lead to fatigue
                    and musculoskeletal strain [5]. This project, therefore, seeks to improve the usability and comfort
                    of lead aprons to reduce these physical burdens while maintaining their protective function.

                    <p>
                        Our primary research with healthcare professionals (HCP) highlighted critical issues regarding
                        weight, hygiene, and mobility in current radiation PPE. Below is a breakdown of each category
                        based on practitioners' feedback:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Weight: The heavy lead aprons, often weighing up to 7kg, create significant physical strain
                            on
                            practitioners, leading to muscle fatigue and back pain.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>
                            Hygiene: Shared lead aprons bring about hygiene concerns, as practitioners are uncertain
                            about
                            how often these are cleaned. Due to the intense physical activity involved, wearing aprons
                            underneath scrubs leads to excessive sweating, which raises discomfort levels. Practitioners
                            indicated that cleaning these aprons between uses isn't always feasible, adding to the
                            hygiene
                            issue.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>
                            Mobility: The bulkiness and weight of the PPE restrict practitioners' movement, making it
                            challenging to perform certain procedures.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Among the issues identified, the weight of lead aprons emerged as a top concern, significantly
                        impacting comfort and safety during prolonged procedures. Notably, 100% of interviewees from the
                        orthopaedics department cited the weight of the aprons as an issue (Fig. 6).

                    <p>
                        The weight of the lead apron worn by orthopaedic surgical teams during fluoroscopy-guided
                        surgeries causes significant fatigue, compromising their well-being and quality of life. This
                        physical strain also limits the number of surgeries they can perform each week, impacting both
                        healthcare delivery and practitioner health.

                        <h4> 2.3.1 Xenolite Gowns </h4>
                        <p>
                            Xenolite gowns provide lead-free, lightweight, and flexible x-ray protection by using a
                            carefully balanced mix of antimony and tungsten as shielding elements. This combination is
                            designed to optimize weight while maximizing protection within the diagnostic imaging range
                            of 80–100 kV. Antimony primarily attenuates lower-energy photons (below 88 keV), while
                            tungsten, a heavier element, is effective against higher-energy radiation (above 69 keV).
                            The powdered antimony and tungsten particles are uniformly embedded in a durable yet
                            flexible Dow elastomer matrix, developed by Dow-DuPont for applications requiring resilience
                            and flexibility, like running shoes and cables. This elastomer was chosen for its balance of
                            strength and flexibility, enhancing the apron’s durability and resistance to cracking.
                            Furthermore, the material is environmentally friendly as it is not cross-linked, meaning it
                            can be recycled or safely disposed of as non-hazardous waste [11]. However, Xenolite
                            provides a lead equivalency of 0.5 mm at 80 keV but may offer less protection at higher
                            energy levels (e.g., 100 keV as seen in Table 2), where advanced imaging equipment is often
                            used [5].

                        <h4> 2.3.2 Suspended Radiation Protection System (Zero-Gravity) </h4>
                        <p>
                            Zero-Gravity is a weightless support system that uses a suspended, 1.0 mm lead shield,
                            magnetically attached to a vest worn by the operator. This design allows the system to move
                            smoothly with the user and be easily retracted when not in use. Available in various
                            configurations—such as floor unit, monorail, and hinged swing-arm versions—Zero-Gravity can
                            adapt to different room layouts and procedure requirements. By eliminating the need for
                            heavy protective gear, it minimizes the risk of orthopaedic strain for clinicians, enhancing
                            comfort without compromising radiation protection [14]. Although Zero-Gravity allows some
                            movement, it restricts certain actions like bending and can limit mobility, especially when
                            walking [1].

                    <p>
                        Our product, ShieldX, improves comfort and reduces fatigue specifically associated with the
                        weight of radiation PPE (lead gowns) for orthopaedic surgical teams in Singapore. By enhancing
                        weight distribution and decreasing perceived heaviness, ShieldX enables greater mobility and
                        freedom of movement during complex procedures. ShieldX aims to increase user satisfaction
                        regarding the weight aspect of PPE from 0% to 60% by April 2025, all while maintaining current
                        radiation protection standards.

                                <li>Weight Reduction:The lattice design employs a network of geometric
                                    patterns (e.g., hexagonal, grid, or triangular) to distribute material only where
                                    needed, reducing bulk and enhancing flexibility.</li>
                                <li>High Strength-to-Weight Ratio: The framework provides a strong yet
                                    lightweight base, making the gown easier to wear for extended periods.</li>
                                <li>Reinforced Points: Critical load-bearing areas, such as the
                                    shoulders and spine, are strengthened to prevent deformation and sagging under
                                    prolonged use.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
